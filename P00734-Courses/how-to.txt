1. create a folder where to add the course structure
2. git clone https://INGCDaaS@dev.azure.com/INGCDaaS/IngOne/_git/P00734-Courses

3. we use the "naster" branch as main branch
4. create your own branch to experiment

> git checkout naster
> git pull
> git checkout -b my-new-branch
> git push

continue to play in your own branch and push your experiments if you want to share them with the others.

After getting the code, in the same folder where package.json file is, run:
> npm install
It will install the dependecies packages into a new folder: node_modules

To start the webserver run:
> npm run serve

Webserver will listen to port 3333 so this port should be free.

At this moment you can request pages into brower's url.

Ex for page.html in folder .../2/page.html :
http://localhost:3333/2/page.html

Changes made in code are intercepted by nodemon and republished so you do not 
have to restart the webserver after changes. Only refresh the browser.

Thank you!
